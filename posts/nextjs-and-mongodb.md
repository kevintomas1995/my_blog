If you are working on a fullstack project, sooner or later you probably will get into the situation where you need to connect your web app to a database. In this blog post I will use **MongoDB**. This is pretty straight forward non-SQL database, which you can easily use for free!

## How to get started?
Before we can dive into the actual code, you will firstly need to set up some things concerning MongoDB. Firstly, create an account [here](https://www.mongodb.com/de-de/cloud/atlas). We will be using MongoDB cloud atlas.

After completing your registration and setting up an organization, you mainly will need to set up to things. Go to **Database Access** and add a new user. Make sure, that this user has read and write access! Use **password** as the authentication method and note this password, because you will need it soon.

After setting up your user, go to **Network Access** 





```js
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}

printBasics();
```
